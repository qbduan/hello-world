## Bayesian framework for ODE parameter estimation
### The ODE system 
1. Input a set of paramters
2. Run the ODE model for certain time period
3. Output some time series
4. Summrize the output time series to get same format with observation
### Bayesian 
\[f() \]
 Depending on the underlying statistical model the likelihood function can
become very complex and sometimes might not even be available in closed form.
